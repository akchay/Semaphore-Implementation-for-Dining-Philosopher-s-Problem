DOWN


Name 
         down - does a down on a semaphore
         
         
        
SYNOPSIS
         #include <lib.h>
         #include <unistd.h>
         int down (void)
         
         
DESCRIPTION

        DOWN causes the calling process to do a down on a semaphore. If the state of that semaphore was initially 1 
        then the state is set to 0 and the process enters the critical region. Otherwise if the state of the semaphore
        was initially 0 and a process calls down, then the calling process is put into the queue.
        
        
RETURN VALUE

Upon successful down, 1 is returned. On unsuccessful down, -1 is returned. If the process is put into the queue then 
SUSPEND is returned. 


ERRORS

On reference of a pointer to NULL memory, error is generated
